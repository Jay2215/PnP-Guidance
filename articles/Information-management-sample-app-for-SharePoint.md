# Information management sample add-in for SharePoint
As part of your Enterprise Content Management (ECM) strategy, you can get or set site policies to manage the lifecycle of your SharePoint site.

    
 _**Applies to:** Office 365 | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint Online_

    
The [Core.InformationManagement](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP/tree/master/Samples/Core.InformationManagement) sample shows you how to use an ASP.NET provider-hosted SharePoint add-in to get and set a site policy on a site. Use this solution if you want to:
    

- Apply policy settings during your custom site provisioning process. 
    
- Create a new or modify an existing site policy.
    
- Create a custom expiration formula.

## Before you begin
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

To get started, download the  [Core.InformationManagement](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP/tree/master/Samples/Core.InformationManagement) sample add-in from the [Office 365 Developer patterns and practices](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP/tree/dev) project on GitHub.

We recommend that you create at least one site policy, and assign it to your site before you run this add-in. Otherwise, the add-in will start without displaying sample data. For more information, see  [Overview of site policies in SharePoint 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/jj219569%28v=office.15%29.aspx).


## Using the Core.InformationManagement sample app
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When you start the app, the start page displays the following information, as shown in Figure 1:


- The site's closure and expiration dates. These dates are specific to a site and are based on the configuration settings of the site policy that is applied.
    
- All site policies that can be applied to the site.
    
- The site policy that is currently applied.
    
- The option box to select and apply a new site policy to the site.
    

**Figure 1. Information Management add-in start page**

![Screenshot of the add-in start page, with site policy closure and expiration values, available and applied site policies, and other policies to apply highlighted.](media/8c5f39f7-700d-4300-bcc4-9ed9edf0e155.png)

From your SharePoint site, you can go to the app, which runs on the remote host, by choosing  **Recent** > **Core.InformationManagement**. To return to your SharePoint site, choose  **Back to Site**.

The Pages\Default.aspx.cs file in the Core.InformationManagementWeb project contains the code for the page displayed in Figure 1. 

The following code in the  **Page_Load** method of the Default.aspx.cs page fetches and displays the closure and expiration dates of the site, based on the applied site policy. This code calls the **GetSiteExpirationDate** and **GetSiteCloseDate** extension methods of the OfficeDevPnP.Core project.


    
**Note**  The code in this article is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including any implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or non-infringement.




```C#
// Get site expiration and closure dates.
if (cc.Web.HasSitePolicyApplied())
{
        lblSiteExpiration.Text = String.Format("The expiration date for the site is {0}", cc.Web.GetSiteExpirationDate());
        lblSiteClosure.Text = String.Format("The closure date for the site is {0}", cc.Web.GetSiteCloseDate());
}

```

The following code in the  **Page_Load** method of the Default.aspx.cs page displays the names of all site policies that can be applied to the site (including the currently applied site policy). This code calls the **GetSitePolicies** extension method of the OfficeDevPnP.Core project.




```C#
// List the defined policies.
List<SitePolicyEntity> policies = cc.Web.GetSitePolicies();
string policiesString = "";
foreach (var policy in policies)
                    {
                        policiesString += String.Format("{0} ({1}) <BR />", policy.Name, policy.Description);
                    }
lblSitePolicies.Text = policiesString;
            };

```

The following code in the  **Page_Load** method of the Default.aspx.cs page displays the name of the site policy currently applied to the site. This calls the **GetAppliedSitePolicy** extension method of the OfficeDevPnP.Core project.




```C#
// Show the assigned policy.
SitePolicyEntity appliedPolicy = cc.Web.GetAppliedSitePolicy();
if (appliedPolicy != null)
            {
            lblAppliedPolicy.Text = String.Format("{0} ({1})", appliedPolicy.Name, appliedPolicy.Description);
            }
else
            {
            lblAppliedPolicy.Text = "No policy has been applied";
            }

```

The following code in the  **Page_Load** method of the Default.aspx.cs page populates the drop-down list with the site policies that are available, except for the site policy that is currently assigned to the site.




```C#
// Fill the policies combo.
foreach (var policy in policies)
{
if (appliedPolicy == null || !policy.Name.Equals(appliedPolicy.Name, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))
{
                            drlPolicies.Items.Add(policy.Name);
           }
}
btnApplyPolicy.Enabled = drlPolicies.Items.Count > 0;


```

The following code in the Default.aspx.cs page applies the selected site policy to the site. The original site policy is replaced by the new site policy. 




```C#
protected void btnApplyPolicy_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
if (drlPolicies.SelectedItem != null)
            {
                cc.Web.ApplySitePolicy(drlPolicies.SelectedItem.Text);
                Page.Response.Redirect(Page.Request.Url.ToString(), true);
            }
}

```
